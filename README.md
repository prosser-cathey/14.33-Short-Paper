14.33 Short Paper

Here are the contents of this repo:

mask_policy.csv - County-level data of mask mandates from Wright et al. (2020)

class_data.csv - The data provided to us in class, contains a couple different things but all I use is the Re-opening Dates and the Mask Mandate Dates

consumer_spending.csv - Daily county-level data on average consumer spending relative to pre-pandemic levels

ruralurban.csv - Each U.S. county coded by population

presvotes.csv - Each U.S. county and how they voted in the 2016 Presidential Election

cases.csv - Daily new coronavirus cases by county

StateTax.csv - Data on state tax revenues

14.33 Short Paper.R - My R script that takes the above csv files and runs the analysis. 

All csv files are almost the same as they can be found at the original sources. The only changes were splitting columns of dates into multiple columns and combining information from multiple pages of the same website for StateTax.csv.
